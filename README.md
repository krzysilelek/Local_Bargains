#Web application to display local bargains.

The aim of the work is to design and implement a web application to display bargains from various shops based on the user’s location. The application includes three panels. A logged-in user panel, a non-logged-in user panel and an administrator panel.

The panel of the non-logged-in user has a view that allows searching for bargains
stored in the database. Filter can be applied to the search. Selecting an item from the
list takes user to the product card of the list of bargains. The product card contains
information on:

- product information on bargain,
- the category of the bargain,
- (optional) photo of the product,
- location of the shop offering the bargain - visualisation of the location on a map.

The logged-in user panel allows users to rate and comment on bargains, this is to
demonstrate the reliability of the information source. Logged-in users can also report
bargains or add their own. One’s own bargains can later be edited.

The administrator panel allows the deletion of bargains (which are considered unre-
liable). It also allows the user account to be suspended from the database or deleted
altogether. It can also add new categories of occasions.
